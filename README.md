PebbleGasFinder
===============

This Pebble watch app will easily allow you to find the closest & cheapest gas station to your current location.

Launch the app and it will start searching for the closest gas station (based on GPS location from phone) - when found it will display the station name, distance & direction from your current location and regular, premium and diesel prices (if applicable). It will then start to search for the cheapest gas station in a 10 mile radius and display the same information on the bottom half of the watch.


**Notes**

1. Requires httpebble to be installed on your device. 
2. Separate Android & iOS versions - please choose the watch app that applies to your phone if downloading from My Pebble Faces website.
